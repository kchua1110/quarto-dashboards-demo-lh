```{r, setup}

```



This is a simple dashboard created with Quarto using penguins. 
Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.


## Row 1

```{r}
#| title: Penguin Scatter Plot

ggplot(data = penguin_df, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c(
        "Adelie" = "purple2",
        "Chinstrap" = "orange",
        "Gentoo" = "cyan4"
    )) +
    labs(
        title = NULL,
        x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
        y = "Body Mass (g)",
        color = "Species"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
```

## Row 2



```{r}
#| title: Bill Depth Distribution of Chinstrap

penguin_df %>%
    filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "orange") +
    labs(title = NULL,
         x = "Bill Depth (mm)",
         y = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```



```{r}
#| title: Penguin Species on Biscoe Island

# subsetted penguins data frame
biscoe_sp <- penguin_df %>% 
    filter(island == "Biscoe") %>% 
    group_by(species) %>% 
    summarize(count = n())
    
# bar plot 
ggplot(data = biscoe_sp, aes(x = species, y = count)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = species)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c(
        "Adelie" = "purple2",
        "Gentoo" = "cyan4"
    )) +
    labs(title = NULL,
         x = NULL,
         y = "Number of species",
         fill = "Species") +
    theme_minimal() 
```
